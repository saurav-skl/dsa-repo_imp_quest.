I have started my Leetcode journey from 3 months, and I have solved few problems along the way. I had to manage my college courses and prepping up Algorithms and Data Structures, so I wasn't able to grind as much problems as I would have liked to.

Prepping up Data Structures and Algorithms
I used another platform for reviewing basic data structures and algorithms. I never really prepared algorithms seriously, so I decided to review all basic algorithms and ds. I started coding basic data structures and reviewed basic algorithm paradigms and solved first 7-10 problems from each topic. This helped me in warming up with the topic and I was aware of basic tricks associated with basic problems.

Learning Collections / STL library
Start learning STL/Collections library if you haven't heard of it. Even though we can code up basic sorting, simple data structures such as stack/queue, we don't always have to code them while solving problems, we can always use them to fast track solving problems, so we can spend time in solving our problem, rather than coding the repititive algorithms and data structures.

List of Problems topic wise
Finally, here is a list of problems that I solved topic wise and wasn't able to solve them in the first chance. I used solutions / discuss to check the approach of solving problems. Few are some which are worth revisiting. Finally, I have solved around 137 problems, so that should suffice for a beginner to onboard with the process of leetcode grind.

I haven't started solving problems from graphs and other intermediate topics, so I don't have them now, but once I have archive of some good problems, I would certainly share with the leetcode community.
